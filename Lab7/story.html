        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Shrivardhan is a quaint town which is located in the Raigad district of Maharashtra and is well known for its beaches
          and the shrine of Laxminarayan. The town is also well known as the land of the Peshwas as the first Peshwa Balaji
          Vishwanath hailed from here.
        </p>

        <p>
          The town is renowned as a historically and religiously significant destination. According to legends, Arjuna the Pandava
          is said to have visited the town during his pilgrimage. It also finds its name mentioned in the travel accounts of
          various European travelers, Ziffardan is one amongst them.

          Be it parasailing, banana boat rides, paragliding, horse tanga rides- you can enjoy it all on the beach. We recommend
          you go for a buggy ride along the gorgeous coastline. For those who like adventure, go for parasailing and the banana
          boat rides. The water is clean and if you want, you can always go for a swim or dip in the sea. Post noon, the tides are
          high and you can actually make a splash in the waves. The beach is family-friendly and if you have kids, they are sure
          to have a great time.
